# Sparse Quantum State Preparation

# Overview
This project aims to efficiently prepare sparse quantum states using quantum circuits. The code provided implements algorithms for preparing quantum states with probabilities corresponding to a given sparse vector of probabilities. The objective is to achieve accurate state preparation while minimizing resource utilization and maximizing fidelity.

Code Structure
main() function: This function serves as the entry point for the quantum circuit. It allocates qubits for output and applies quantum operations based on the provided sparse states.
process_states() function: This function processes the quantum states based on the operations defined in ops1, ops2, ops3, ops4, and ops5.
Helper functions: Functions like flip_bit() and calculate_angle() are provided to facilitate the state preparation process.
Usage
Define the sparse states dictionary with probabilities.
Call the main() function with the sparse states dictionary as input.
The code will generate a quantum circuit to prepare the specified quantum states efficiently.
Requirements
  Python 3.x
  Classiq Python SDK
Additional Notes
    Ensure to install the necessary dependencies before running the code.
    Customize the main() function and helper functions as needed for specific use cases.
    Refer to the provided documentation for detailed explanations of each function and algorithm used.
